# React Gallery App

An image gallery app that uses the popular React library. The project is built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

The project uses the Create React App tool and React Router node module in order to create the functionality.

Functionality I had to create:

- Build out the gallery components in a modular fashion using JavaScript and JSX.
- Set up routes with React Router for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Fetch data with Axios from the Flickr API to display images in the app.
- Logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Improve the supplied CSS to personalize the project.

Extra functonality to the highest grading:

- Browser navigation history - The app keeps track of the broser history and changes the page's data based on the current URL. Clicking the browser's forward and back buttons navigate the user through all the search history, keeping the URL and fetched data in sync.
- 404 Error - A 404 error page is displayed in a friendly way when a URL doesn't match an existing route.
- Loading indicator - A loading spinner has been created that displays each time the app fetches new data.
- No Matches Message - A friendly message displays if no matches are found by the search.

Grade: TBC
